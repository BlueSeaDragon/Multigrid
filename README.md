# Adaptive Multigrid
This is an Adaptive Multigrid (AMG) Algorithm for the 2D Wilson-Dirac operator (Schwinger Model). It is based on the "Adaptive Smoothed Aggregate Multigrid" method, where both geometric (sub-blocking) and algebraic (largest eigenvectors dimensional reduction) coarsening are applied. Our implementation uses Gauss-Seidel (GS) as the smoothing operator and Conjugate Gradient (CG) as the direct solver for small sub-blocks.

The next step would be to precondition CG with AMG, such that long and short-range error modes can be effectively eliminated. Another issue is that the algorithm only applies to symmetric (hermitian) positive definite matrices (i.e. $D^H D$, loss of sparsity). A more general solver that works on non-hermitian matrices could be developed to conserve sparsity.
